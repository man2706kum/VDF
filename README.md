# Verifiable Delay Function
This repository contain a simple implimentation of Verifiable Delay Function of one of the two recent VDF proposal due to Wesolowski. The approch in this protocol is interactive but can be made non-interactive using Fiat-Shamir Heuristic. Time-lock puzzle can also be constructed by doing some minor changes to the code as the construction of one of the time-lock puzzle is similar(finding exponention in a hidden order group). The following papers were taken for reference:
